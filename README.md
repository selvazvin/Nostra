🚀Just Launched: A Basic Responsive Website!🚀

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Clean and modern UI
✅ Fully responsive design
✅ Interactive elements with JavaScript
✅ Simple yet effective navigation

💡 This project was a great opportunity to enhance my front-end skills and focus on user experience across different screen sizes.
